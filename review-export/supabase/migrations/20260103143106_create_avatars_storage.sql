  # Create Avatar Storage Bucket

  1. New Storage Bucket
    - `avatars` - stores user profile photos
    - Max file size: 2MB
    - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif

  2. Security
    - Public read access for all avatars
    - Authenticated users can upload their own avatar
    - Users can only update/delete their own avatar

  3. Important Notes
    - Storage buckets use Row Level Security for access control
    - Avatar URLs will be public but only the owner can modify them
